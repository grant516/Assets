# Overview

This software is a GitHub game made to help kids learn and practice their math operators. They do this by going through a maze and encountering doors that will ask them a math question. Once they answer the question correctly, they are allowed access through the door. Once they complete the maze, a certificate is given to the player showing they finished the educational maze.
